## <a name="aboutme">:mag_right: ABOUT ME</a>

<p align="justify">Hi, my name is Yauheni (if you want to spell it just say Eugene). I'm 26, I currently work for a logistics company, and in my free time I do various freelance jobs as a QA manual.  I'm looking for my first commercial expirience as a QA.  <b>I thirst for knowledge and new challenges.</b> I needed a profession that allow me <b>constantly self-develop</b> and <b>use my talent to find errors</b>.</p>


<p align="justify"><b>What are my skills?</b> During my training process, I have learned <b>SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman, GIT</b> and <b>HTML/CSS</b> basics.</p>
